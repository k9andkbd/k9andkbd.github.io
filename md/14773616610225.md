# iPad Pro Mini?

Today’s [Apple Event](http://www.apple.com/apple-events/march-2016/) held no surprises on the hardware side of things. A smaller iPhone SE, and a [new 9.7” iPad Pro](http://www.apple.com/ca/ipad-pro/specs/), with it’s own Smart Keyboard and Apple Pencil support.

##Our Responsibility##
Tim Cook's opening speech about privacy and the government was a great way to start the event.
>We need to decide as a nation, how much power the government should over over our data and over our privacy. ...We did not expect to be in this position, at odds with our own government. But we believe strongly that we have a responsibility to help you protect your data and protect your privacy. We owe it to our customers and we own it to our country.  This is an issue that impacts all of us and we will not shrink from this responsibility.

There isn't much commentary could I offer after that quote.  I think the FBI took this declaration pretty seriously because just hours after the event, they [asked the judge to delay the March 22nd hearing](http://www.cbc.ca/news/technology/fbi-apples-help-not-needed-1.3501598).  It turns out they may have found a way to decrypt the phone without Apple's help.  

Or perhaps more likely, this is just a way to avoid losing this challenge in court and saving face.  We may never know for sure.

##Assembled by Humans, Recycled by a Robot##
Next Apple's Vice President of Environment, Policy and Social Initiatives, [Lisa Jackson](http://www.apple.com/ca/pr/bios/lisa-jackson.html) presented the company's current initiatives with regards to the Environment.  It feels good to know that this giant company that could do what ever it wants is making such a commitment to the Environment all around the world.  It's a challenge to other industry leaders to step up efforts when it comes to Environmental impact and stewardship.  

Apple also unveiled their new in-house developed [iPhone dissembling robot named Liam](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AYshVbcEmUc) with an absolutely charming video.  The video does a great job of anthropomorphizing what’s really just an industrial robot.  It’s like a cute puppy that recycles iPhones.

##An iPad Pro in Air's Clothing##

The smaller iPad Pro is just what I've been waiting for. I’ve got a few days before pre-orders are live to decide what configuration of the [smaller iPad Pro](http://www.apple.com/ca/ipad-pro/specs/) I'll be ordering. Surely not 32GB, but there is a new 256GB option to consider.  Wowsers that’s a lot of storage, Twice that of the 13” Macbook Pro I use daily.  My current iPad Mini 2 has cellular (and GPS by extension) but now that tethering is working great with my iPhone I don’t see the need to dish out an additional $179.

At the moment the Apple Pencil is in stock but it  will no doubt remain rare in the wild and probably require waiting a few weeks to receive after ordering.  The Smart Keyboard is pretty pricey at $200.  I’ll wait to see what Logitech and there third party manufactures offer before I decide to pick one up.

I’m curious to see if it is possible to live in a Post-PC future right now.  The idea is to use the iPad Pro to replace my Macbook Pro for as many uses as possible.  I’ll be working on [Mushometer](http://canineandkeyboard.com/mushometer.html) via the Macbook Pro until Apple announces Xcode for iPad, fingers crossed for a [WWDC](https://developer.apple.com/wwdc/) announcement.

The new woven nylon Apple Watch bands are nice but I want to see them in person before picking one up.  I like the black one but the ease of fastening the current sport band I have makes me think that a more traditional buckle would be an annoyance.  The Apple Watch Sport price drop is the real good news.  Hopefully with more Apple Watches on more wrists, developers will have more of an incentive to  develop [great watch apps](http://conradstoll.com/blog/2016/3/13/great-watch-apps-great-complications).

And one more thing, Apple's 40th birthday is on April 1st, my 38th birthday! 

**Update: Spontaneously woke up at 3:01 AM EST and ordered the silver 128 GB model with an apricot Smart Cover and the Apple Pencil.  Counting the days until it arrives.**
