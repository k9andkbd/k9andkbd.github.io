Thanks to everyone who takes the time to contact me with suggestions and bug reports.  It's because of your feedback that Mushometer has continued to evolve for the past seven years!

## Current Bug List
Usually I try to fix bugs as quickly as I can.  Here are the list of issues that I know about but haven't been able to reproduce or fix yet.  If you are having a bug listed below or something else, let me know about it too.

* Emoji characters cause problems if they are used in Notes on Runs, Teams or Trails.
* Sometimes if the GPS signal is lost during recording long lines will be drawn on the map and the distance calculations are not accurate.  I can't really fix this but I'm working on a way to clearly indicate that there were problems recording during the run. If this happens to you and you know the approximate distance of your trail, you can always set the distance manually after the run has been recorded.

## FAQ
The FAQ has been moved into the  [Mushometer User Guide](/mushometeruserguide.html#FAQ).
