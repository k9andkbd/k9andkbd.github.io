I’d love to try making one of these for while on the dog sled.  I’m eagerly awaiting the how to video for building this contraption!

##VFX Breakdown
There were some visually incredible movies released in 2015.  Every time I talk to someone about The Martian I can’t help but harangue about how I feel that Mars is a place I’ve really seen.  

Here are some VFX reels from three of my favourites in 2015, including The Martian. The three films below are all nominated for Oscar's in the Visual Effects category this year.  If history repeats itself, Starwars will probably win the award.  Gravity and Interstellar won in 2013 and 2014 so a win for The Martian would make it a space movie hat-trick.

##Is an Artificial Universe so Much Different Than Our Own?
[The Atlantic](http://www.theatlantic.com/technology/archive/2016/02/artificial-universe-no-mans-sky/463308/) has posted the great article about the procedurally generated universe of No Man’s Sky, an upcoming game for Sony’s Playstation 4 Game console.  I’m absolutely in love with the visual aesthetic of the game and I’m really looking forward to this one. Here’s a short video that show’s off a bit of what the game has in store for us come June, [Things I've Seen Trailer](https://gaming.youtube.com/watch?v=-UVQ14JrfRI).

I’d love to make one of these.  It’s a perfect project for a rainy weekend in February when the dogs and I can’t go out on the sled.
