# Presenting the Canine & Keyboard Logo

When the idea for this blog finally presented itself, the logo idea was fully formed too.  I did a very quick place holder that you can see below.   The pure definition of [Programmer Art](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Programmer_art).  I couldn't publish anything with that in the header.  

When the opportunity presented itself to have the super talented [Boum](http://boumerie.com) work up a version for me, I jumped at it and I'm glad she accepted.  I sent along my horrible mockup, some photos of Spryte with keyboard and she nailed what I had in mind on the first crack.

I've already said that she's super-talented but you don't have to take my word for it.  Check our her day in the life webcomic at [boumerie.com](http://boumerie.com).  She's also recently launched a new web comic serilization of her 2012 book "La Petite RÃ©volution" (A Small Revolution).  Published for the first time in English. You can check that out at [revolution.boumerie.com](http://revolution.boumerie.com).

Thank you Sam. <i class="fa fa-heart"></i>
