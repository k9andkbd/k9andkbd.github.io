# The Quantified Canine

Tracking personal data is a big thing these days.  There are Fitbits, and Jawbones and many other personal fitness trackers for humans on the market right now.  We all *hope* that by collecting all this data about our daily activities we will be happier and healthier.  This movement has been dubbed [The Quantified Self](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quantified_Self).

With all the buzz, it make sense that over the last year or so there have been a number of products announced to extend this data collection and analysis to cover our 4-legged friends.

I've got an interest in this market as the maker of an app for tracking performance data for dogs.  I'm also into gadgets, so it should be no surprise that I think these things are neat.  

As neat as the idea may be not sure how useful this data would be to the average dog owner, let alone someone with a team of sled dogs.  I think that having a GPS fix on your dog could be great if she's the type to get away often for unauthorized excursions, but I think that the money could be better spent on securing the dog.

As for Activity tracking, left to their own devices, dogs would sleep most of the day.  If your dog is going to be active, you probably need to be doing something to motivate that activity, wether it be playing fetch, going for a walk or harnessing up the team for a run.  In that case, you've already got a pretty good idea of what kind of physical activity your pet is getting on a daily basis.

I'd love to give one of these devices a shot if they came in to the $50 price range, but at $99-$200 a pop, and given the effectiveness of Siberian teeth, I'll just keep an eye out for now.
