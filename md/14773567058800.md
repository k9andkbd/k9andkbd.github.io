#Is This Thing On?

its been more than 4 years since I turned off the lights on my [old blog](http://darkewolf.com/).  It was a fun place to learn web development and tinker with things. sadly I just ran out of interesting things to write about.  That seems to be a pretty common issue with blogging.

But the itch to write remained...

Over the past year I have toyed with the idea of writing again. The problem was to figure out how to unite my two interests so that I could write about each of them, dogs and technology.

Then, walking to work one morning last fall the idea for Canine & Keyboard was born.

I'll write as my muse allows on subjects of my interest in the dog and technology worlds, sometimes both, or neither!  

I hope you'll come along for the ride.
