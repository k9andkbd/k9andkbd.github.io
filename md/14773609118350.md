Better one day late than never.  I'll have to figure out some other way to do these link posts since they all need unique titles.

##[The Saint of Dry Creek](http://kottke.org/15/11/dont-sneak)##
All of StoryCorps animations are really touching, this one hit particularly close to home for me.  Everyone should have a parent as supportive.  

##[When Women Stopped Coding](http://www.npr.org/sections/money/2014/10/17/356944145/episode-576-when-women-stopped-coding)##
We learned about the women pioneers in the field of computer science when I was in University.  No one ever discussed what changed to cause such a drop-off women programmers in the industry.  NPR’s Planet Money podcast thinks they’ve figured out what happened.  As a child of the 1980’s I remember all the marketing materials of the home computer of the time were totally focused on boys like me.  I was their perfect target and followed the typical path into computers.  There’s still hope that we can turn things around.


##[Joseph Gordon-Levitt's "Rhythm Nation”](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZPWs1QkK9k8#t=243)##
This Lip-Sync Battle is incredible.  JGL totally nails the song and choreography.  Rhythm Nation is an incredible album and I still listen to it fairly regularly.

##[Architecture of Radio](http://www.architectureofradio.com)##
This neat App uses publicly available data to let you see the wifi, cellular and satellite networks around you.  Don’t expect to see your home wifi router, but it’s a neat visualization of the radio waves surrounding us.

##[Cascadia](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GL0rbxB9Lqg)##
Another inspiring ride by Danny MacAskill. 

##[A Link to the Past Soundtrack, Pico 8 edition](https://soundcloud.com/gruber99/sets/the-legend-of-zelda-alttp-pico)##
The constraints of [Pico-8](http://www.lexaloffle.com/pico-8.php) give these iconic SNES compositions a new, 8-bit sound.

##[Adr1ft](http://www.theverge.com/2015/12/11/9880370/adrift-virtual-reality-oculus-rift)##
I really enjoyed [Gravity](http://www.imdb.com/title/tt1454468/). The though of being able to experience something like that is really intriguing to me.  I haven’t had the opportunity to try the [Occulus](https://www.oculus.com/en-us/rift/) yet but [recent announcements from Sony](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5Sk5ThgnI2k) and games like Adr1ft have piqued my interest.  I’m pretty sure that within a year I’ll own at least one if not both of these setups, even if it means having to [build a PC](http://www.macworld.com/article/2922722/no-oculus-rift-for-the-mac-but-your-mac-couldnt-handle-it-anyway.html) for the Occulus.
