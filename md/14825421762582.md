The show is incredible.  I think the thing that I find most wonderful about this show isn't the sci-fi premise, it's that these eight people couldn't be more different, and yet they help and learn from each other how to be stronger, better, people.  If that's not a good message for the times we live in I don't know what is.

Awesome Scifi premise in a show that's really about people.  Quantum Leap and Orphan Black come to mind as shows that I love that also fit into this genre.
