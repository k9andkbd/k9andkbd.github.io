# Forms In Nature / Can You Do It

One of the reasons I love twitter is because I can follow a whole bunch of interesting people and have these types of gems land in my lap without doing anything.  These two wonderful pieces of animation landed in my timeline today.  They are different but I really love this style of design, with lots of geometric shapes, harkening back to the days of low-poly computer art.  I'd put a game like [Another World](http://www.hardcoregaming101.net/anotherworld/anotherworld.htm) in the same visual group.  Anyway, enjoy the videos below.
