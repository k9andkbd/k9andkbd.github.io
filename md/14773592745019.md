# Furry Star Stuff

>"We are a way for the universe to know itself. Some part of our being knows this is where we came from. We long to return. And we can, because the cosmos is also within us. We're made of star stuff." - [Carl Sagan](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carl_Sagan), [Cosmos](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cosmos:_A_Personal_Voyage)

I too believe that humans and other conscious creatures are the universe looking back at itself.  And When I look into the eyes of my dogs I see the universe staring back at me and judging me purely.  It's a huge responsibility to live up to raising part of the universe.  

If only we humans would treat each other with such respect and care, we're all made of the same star stuff.

It's by with our intelligence, our technology and our furry companions that humans learned to survive and thrive.  I still feel a bit of that when I'm out alone with the team.  It's us against the universe.  There's no one that can come and save us when things go sideways.  It was especially true this winter in -25C weather, with blowing winds and nearly white-out conditions.  There were some crazy moments on the trail but by working together we always came home safely.

That's one of the reasons I mush.  It's an incredibly special experience to work with these furry friends of mine.  To teach them, and to learn from them, to trust in them and to become something better together than we could ever be on our own.
