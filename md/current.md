#Raymond M. Smith (1937-2018)

I love you. 

I miss you. 

You were my best friend, my mentor, my everything. 

You gave me so much - the dogs, a lifetime of traveling together, a family. 

Because of you I am a better person in every way. 

Twenty years was not nearly enough, but we made the best of the time we had.

Thank you.
