#[Looking at 360° Action Cameras for Mushing](?p=LookingAt360ActionCamerasForMushing)

This last season of mushing was fantastic.  I was able to hit the trails 2 or three times a week from late September until early March.  I mostly used my iPhone 11 Pro to record videos from the trail because the quality is so much better than the old Go Pro Hero 2 that I have.

I had been thinking about replacing my ancient Go Pro for a while. There’s no point in using it if I’ll always be disappointed by the video quality, and it’s not a great idea to be mushing with only one hand on the sled and an expensive Smart Phone flailing through the air.

I didn’t really know what was available on the market so [The Best Action Camera article from Wirecutter](https://www.nytimes.com/wirecutter/reviews/best-action-camera/) was pretty helpful.  I figured that don’t really need all the bells and whistles of the Go Pro Hero 9, so the Hero 7 would probably do.

Then while surfing Youtube I re-discovered the world of [Parkour videos](https://youtu.be/owg3jgSARag).  Not only is Parkour still a thing, I saw from some videos that 360° Cameras are available now. The resulting footage, once edited, looked incredible.   Having a drone would be fun for capturing footage while on the sled but I mostly train alone so that really kills that idea.  I could definitely manage a stick or sled mounted camera while on the trail.  It seems like the next best thing.

I’ll always have a better camera for regular video shooting because of my tendency to upgrade the iPhone every two years.  The novelty of having a camera that can do something cool that I can’t do with the iPhone is pretty appealing.  Being able to pan around in the raw 360 video using keyframes to build the camera movement seems like magic. [Here’s an example of editing with the Insta360 App](https://youtu.be/OlpFZbpRFUU).  The ability to do all the editing on an iPhone or iPad is something that also really appeals to me.  I did all my video editing this season on the iPhone and iPad and I don’t want to be dependant on a computer for that.

I’ve spent a lot of time over the last week comparing the pros and cons of the Go Pro Max and the Insta 360 One R.  I am pretty sold on the Insta360 due to it’s cheaper price, more flexible lense options and smart phone App.  That being said you should never buy a piece of tech because of a future upgrade promises, so I consider the modularity of the Insta360 to be a cool bonus but not a huge factor in my decision. 

I’ll update this post when I order something.


**Update:** I've ordered the Insta360 One R.  Hopefully I'll have it in time for a little kayaking adventure next weekend.
