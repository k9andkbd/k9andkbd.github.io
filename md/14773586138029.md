# Almost Time

The tech world is waiting for [Apple's Special Event](http://www.apple.com/live/) on Monday to hear the final details and availability of the [Watch](http://www.apple.com/watch/).  I'll be ordering one for sure so that I can play with some ideas I have for watch apps. Surely [Mushometer](https://itunes.apple.com/app/id369881803) will have a watch extension. 

Watch Sport in black. 42mm or 38mm, I'm not sure.  Black or Green Fluoroelastomer band? Choices.

_March 9th Update:_ Now that all the details are out, I'm pretty confident I'll order the 38mm with the green band.  I've got 30 days to think about it.
