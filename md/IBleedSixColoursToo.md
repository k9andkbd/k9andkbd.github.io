# I Bleed Six Colours Too

Everyone knows that I'm the "Apple fanboy" and at work I'm the Mac "evangalist".  With the new [Steve Jobs book](https://itunes.apple.com/us/book/becoming-steve-jobs/id936502684?mt=11) coming out and the Apple Watch launch on the horizon I've been thinking a bit about my own computer history.

## The Commodore 
The first computer we owned was a [Commodore 64](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Commodore_64).  It was an great computer in the mid 80's.  I typed in the code listings from computer magazines like [Run](https://archive.org/details/run-magazine) and [Family Computing](https://archive.org/details/family-computing) and learned to program in basic.  I had a tape drive and then a magical [1541](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Commodore_1541).  Eventually though, I out-grew the computer.  I had my eye on an [Amiga](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Amiga) much to the chargin of my Uncle Jim, who had given my my first experiences with green and black Microsoft Flight Simulator on one of the first PCs I could remember.  The [Amiga](http://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2007/07/a-history-of-the-amiga-part-1/) was a dead-end a waste of time he'd say (and he was ultimately proven right.), but the marketing campaign was pretty effective, and there were so many amazing looking games!

## Boy Meets Mac 
In my 14 year old wisdom I decided on a Macintosh.  I can't even rememeber why really.

My parents took me to Computer World.  Of course, as a somewhat precocious child, I had done my homework and knew exactly what I wanted.  The sales clerk was a bit surprised but soon we  were on our way home with a [Macintosh LCII](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Macintosh_LC) (affectinately known as the pizza-box) and a 12" Monitor. $3000 was a lot of money to spend in 1992 on a computer.  But what a computer it was!  

Going from the 16 colour, low resolution display of the Commodore to the high-resolution 512x384 256 colour display on the LCII was incredible.  I spent countless hours using [ResEdit](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ResEdit) to create sprites for video games, even though I had no tools or any way to write code for the computer.

Later we would buy a 300bps modem, and the Mac guru at Computer World gave me the phone number for his home-run Mac BBS, [Avalon](http://bbslist.textfiles.com/716/).  Call-waiting became my worst enemy!

And then there was sound!  At a time when even the most advanced Soundblaster cards in PCs could only make crude beeps, the Mac could not only play digitized sounds but it had a mic-in jack for recording!  I spent hours recording and editing all the sound effects and music from all my SNES and Genisis games.  I had stacks of floppy disks filled with [.snd](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SND_(file)) files.   Oh those [classic sounds](http://gizmodo.com/5936887/how-to-get-the-classic-mac-sounds-back-into-os-x) were great!  My perfectly recorded version of the [Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles theme](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rS-qFdw-v_o) was a prized posession.  The [Bonus Stage Music from Sonic the Hedgehog 2](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CpU5640iE5k) was also a favourite.

However, as with good things, the love-affair with the LCII had to end.  I wanted to buy a copy of [Fractal Design](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fractal_Design)'s Painter but it required a 13" monitor.  It was 1995. Windows95 was on the horizon and I decided to cross over to into the world of DOS and Windows.  

The LC was unceremoniously boxed up and sold for $600.  I bought a Packard Bell Pentium 75 that came with Windows 3.1 and spent the next 11 years building PCs, upgrading video cards and troubleshooting the Windows Registry.  Apple was having a rough patch and the world of PCs seemed a lot more exciting.  There was [DooM](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Doom_(1993_video_game)), [Mechwarrior 2](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MechWarrior_2:_31st_Century_Combat) and so many other games to play!  I built my own PCs and even started a very short lived consulting and PC repair business with some friends in the early 2000's.

In 2005, Apple announced the Mac Mini.  I already knew a few people that were really into the new Mac and OS X and I was kind of curious myself, but the price was always a concern.  The Mac Mini however, allowed me to dip my toes back in without much risk.  I visited an Apple Store while I was in NYC for [Westminster](http://www.westminsterkennelclub.org) that year to try one and when I got back to Montreal I ordered without hesitation.  It didn't take long before my custom built Windows PC was relegated to webserver duties and I was back full-time in the Mac world.

## The Museum Pieces
In 2001 I rescued 2 [Mac SE](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Macintosh_SE)s from the trash and made one working machine between them. I painted the case forest green and updated it to System 7, played with it a bit and decided to give it away before moving to Canada.

In the kennel there is a [Macintosh IIsi](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Macintosh_IIsi) with a [portrait display](http://www.everymac.com/monitors/apple/classic_monitors/specs/apple_mac_portrait.html) and a [Bondi blue](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blue-green#Bondi_blue) [Power Mac G4](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Power_Mac_G4) that I tried to install Ubuntu on, but I couldn't find the proper hard-disk controller to complete the installation.  

In the mid 90's I had a [Newton Message Pad 100](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MessagePad).  I think by then the ship had sailed on the Newton so I was able to get one for only $200.  The handwritind recognition wasn't that good but I used it to take notes in classes during my senior year of high school.  One fateful day while I was out, my dog Nikki used the Newton as a chew-toy and that was the end of that.

There are also 2 C64s in the barn here. Sadly neither machine will power on but there's a [1702 Monitor](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Commodore_64#/media/File:Commodore_1702_(made_by_JVC)_front.jpg) that still works great!

## It's Just a Computer Right?
When it comes to work, I'm pretty platform agnostic.  Mac, Windows, Linux - if it has a command-line and an IDE I'm good to go.  However if I'm buying a computer for myself, at least until something as interesting and exciting as that Macintosh LCII comes along, I'm sticking with Apple.
