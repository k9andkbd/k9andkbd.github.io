# Untitled Project

I've been thinking about what my next project will be.  I've been sketching out an idea for a new utility App for people managing a kennel full of dogs but sometimes programming, like art, requires a muse to get things moving.  I haven't been inspired to start that serious project yet. However, after playing [Horizon Chase](http://horizonchase.tumblr.com) for few days I've finally became inspired to work on a game project.  

With an afternoon of work I had a small prototype and after a few more hours here and there, I've got a fully "playable" game.  This is just the start.  If you'd like to see things as they develop, you can follow [@k9andkbd](https://twitter.com/k9andkbd) on twitter.  I'll be posting about my progress.  I'm also considering putting a stripped-down version of the code up for people to download.  It's amazing how easily you can make a simple game in Unity.  It's also been eye-opening to start a new project without any of tools and frameworks I'm used to using in my day job.  You can really appreciate what your missing.  At the same time it's a bit refreshing not to be constrained by convention.  My canvas is completely mine to paint as I please.  I hope you may enjoy the results.
