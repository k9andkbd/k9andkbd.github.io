### April 3, 2022

In just under a week I'll be hopping on a plane headed for Portugal.  This trip was originally planned for April 2020 but then the COVID pandamic began and all plans were canceled.  I find it difficult to believe that it is now two years later and we aren't clear of this thing yet.  I thought a lot about moving ahead with the trip.  I am fully vacinated and boosted. Aside from from the flights, I feel that I wouldn't be any safer staying home.  T-6 days to departure.
