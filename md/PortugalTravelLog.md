I'll be updating this post as the adventure continues. [Click here](#update) to jump to the latest update.

### April 3, 2022 
In just under a week I'll be hopping on a plane headed for Portugal.  This trip was originally planned for April 2020 but then the COVID pandamic began and all plans were canceled.  I find it difficult to believe that it is now two years later and we aren't clear of this thing yet.  I thought a lot about moving ahead with the trip.  I am fully vacinated and boosted. Aside from from the flights, I feel that I wouldn't be any safer staying home.  T-6 days to departure.

Today‚Äôs the day!  I‚Äôve passed my Rapid Antigen test which was very well organized and executed. Then came traveler registration with Portugal, which was an absolutely infuriating and stressful experience due to a poorly designed mobile web form.  I should have completed the form before coming to the Airport.  Live and learn.   Check-in and security were uneventful.  Now I‚Äôve got a few hours to wait before take-off.

Well our flight was delayed leaving Montreal because Toronto temporarily shutdown due to excess air traffic. We left over and hour and a half late but just made our connecting flight.

We are in the air and now I‚Äôm really thinking about Ray, our trips. The fact that I am going to need to be the one in control to make anything happen. 

I am missing him quite a bit right now.   I am experiencing this strange feeling, like I had on our first trip to Europe almost 21 years ago. I hope I‚Äôm smarter now. That I learned something from all of our trips. It‚Äôs the test. I‚Äôm so grateful for everything we were able to do together. 

Looking at the flight map, seeing the dots for Buffalo and Montreal is giving me all kinds of feelings. Thinking about all those times I made that drive in one direction or the other. 

These inflight announcements in Portuguese just sound like some weird mashup of Spanish and Russian to me. 

Landing in Lisbon took a while. Ground fog has put all the planes in a holding pattern but we have to land eventually right?  From above the coastline is so pretty. Crashing waves, green fields, tiny wind turbines dot the landscape. 

I didn‚Äôt realize that there was a shuttle bus to my rental car pickup. Took a taxi. The driver seemed a bit miffed that we weren‚Äôt going farther. When I asked for change he elected to give himself a bit of a tip. Ha! 

The rental car is a 4 door silver something or other. My apprehension over driving stick again turned out to be for nothing - they gave me an automatic for the same price. For some reason the in-car system is all in German.  I‚Äôm rolling with it.

The short drive from Lisbon to Evora was a good primer to driving in Portugal. Seems to be very chill. Once again I am reminded how wonderful and efficient trafic circles are.

Hotel is nice and efficient and clean. Pleasant staff. Decided to stay two days so I have some time to plan my next steps. Not sure if I will head back west to the coast or straight south for Albufeira. 

Evora, a classic walled city. Day one was scouting on foot. Day two will be visiting inside if it‚Äôs raining. 

### April 11, 2022 

As predicted it rained all morning, so it was the perfect day to look inside a bunch o churches!

First up was the Capela dos Ossis - the Chaple of Bones.  Yeah it‚Äôs as creepy as it sounds. All the interior walls and columns are formed out of piled bones and skulls. Ugh. 

Right next door is the Cathedral of Evora, a hike up to the top of the tower and a walk around the roof is a must.  There is also a ‚ÄúSecret museum‚Äù which was interesting if only for the fact that it made me remember how wacky religious museums are.

The Templo de Diana - Roman ruins is worth a quick stop.

After those and some clearing weather I made my way out from the city center to walk along the Aquaduct.  Inside the city walls homes have been built in the arches but outside the walls you can really get a look at the impressive structure.

I tracked down the Termas Romanas - Ancient Roman baths inside the Evora Council building, which is impressive in it‚Äôs own right.

Before dinner I visited the Evora public park an was delighted to discover it has a local population of peacocks, as well as some ruins which seem to be a popular spot for the fancy birds.

I ate dinner at O Templo - A literal hole in the wall in location only.  The food was excellent and well priced.  The owner Vasco had a story for every dish, many of which were apparently based on his grandmothers recipes.  I‚Äôm still picking up Portuguese but his stories seemed to be mostly the same in English and Portuguese.  I enjoyed the rabbit salad and the black pork cheeks with orange and watercress salad. 

### April 13, 2022 

Yesterday I Drove from Evora to Beja.  Before leaving Evora I stopped to put some gas in the car.  I know gas seems expensive back home but here the price is over $3 a liter!  In any case it seems that I was able to put the proper type of fuel in the car without incident.  The reason for heading to Beja was to see the tower. It is one of the best towers I have ever climbed!  The 2 euro admission was well worth the view at the top.  It was a raining morning so climbing the exterior steps was a bit sketchy but I‚Äôve never visited a tower that was so accessible, all the way to the top.  Also there were a lot of places where I think in another place someone would have installed a railing.

After visiting the tower and taking a walk around it was time to head to Albufiera.

I really lucked out on my hotel selection Albufiera.  It seemed to be really far from the beach but that is just because of the height difference.  I am sure I walked more than 10 kilometres yesterday, and that half was vertical!  It turns out that Albufiera is a flocking spot for Brits.  It‚Äôs a nice location, and not yet as terrible as Blackpool. Aaha!  

When I came to dinner, all he top rated restaurants on Trip Advisor were Indian restaurants.  Well, I figured I‚Äôll have lots of chances yet for authentic Portuguese quinine so I went for it.  I had a bit of trouble convincing the owner to choose something for me, and then we wrangled a bit of the desired heat level.  I think he was worried but it was fine.  Great flavour with the spice turned up a bit more than what the Chateaugois are accustomed to having. 

After dinner I spent some time walking around downtown and taking in the night life before making my way back up the hill to the hotel so I could rest my feet.

Today I‚Äôll head up the coast, with a lunch break at Sines, and then move on to Setubal to set up camp for the night.  

### April 14, 2022 

Sines was an unexpected surprise!  It was a charming sea-side town with a lovely castle.  Tucked inside the castle was a neat little museum of the town.  The exhibits were wonderful and the whole thing was free to visit!

After the castle and the museum, I walked all over town, all the way down to the boardwalk below the town and back up again.  There was a nice little cafe just outside the castle walls where I had a caf√© com leite and a pastel de Natas.

When I decided I was going to setup for the night in Setubal, just south of Lisbon, I wasn‚Äôt too excited. I booked the local Ibis hotel.  I knew it wouldn‚Äôt be exciting but the price was right, and since I have a car I didn‚Äôt mind staying outside of town.   After my afternoon siesta I headed off to the local Fort.  The views from the top of the Fort walls were quite nice and allowed me to scope out some likely place to stash the car and have a look around on foot.  It wasn‚Äôt until I drove back down the hill and parked my car that I started to get a bit excited about the prospects!  Murals and sculptures galore. Back alleys to investigate, a wonderful strip of park nestled downtown and a lively square.  I had dinner at the highest rated local tavern and it was quite good even if they didn‚Äôt have any oysters!

Tomorrows route from here to Coimbra with a stop in Obdios is already planned.

So I couldn‚Äôt find anything affordable in Coimbra.  I did happened to find a charming little town in the hills with a castle and a youth hostel.  

Along the way I stopped in Obidos which is a really charming 11th central walled town.  I walked the entire circumference of the walls.  I found it really amazing that there was no type of safety railing at all. I feel that if something similar existed in North America we would have installed railings or walls everywhere.

After spending the morning and early afternoon in Obidos I headed north again, to Lous√£, a town in the hills.  There was a nice little castle on the outskirts of town with a very nice boardwalk.  I followed it for a ways and then hiked down the trail into the valley below the castle.  I decided not to go all the way to the bottom.  I made my way back up the trail and then headed to the hostel.

After checking into the hostel I spent the rest of the evening exploring the surrounding town of Lous√£ and hunting down a resturant.  I found a BBQ place that was able to stick me in a corner without a reservation an I had a perfectly cooked skewer of every type of animal you could imaging (Beef, Pork, Chicken and Some sort of sausage).  Each piece was perfectly grilled.

That first night my roommate was from Austria, and the next night we had a German fellow with us. 

In the morning I headed 30 minutes to the north west into the heart of Coimbra.  It‚Äôs a university town.  I found a parking spot near the university and explored the area.  The University‚Äôs Botanical gardens while not the largest I have ever visited were quite pleasant.  Ray would have enjoyed walking through them.  I then moved my car down to the riverbank and ventured into the really touristy parts of the city.  It‚Äôs a very hilly area.  If I wasn‚Äôt climbing up something I was slowly making my way down it.  In the end I walked over 30,000 steps throughout the day!  I visited the University Chemistry Lab and the Famous Joana Library.  To be honest I didn‚Äôt find it worth the trouble, and there were no photos allowed so of course I took some out of spite.

This morning after a quick breakfast I packed up my wears and hit the road north toward Braga.  Looking for a place to stop for a snack after a couple of hours of driving I found the sea-side town of Esmoriz.  It was the perfect place to watch the waves crashed into the beach an have a cup of coffee with some sort of flaky pastry topped with sugar and peanuts.  It was great, not too sweet!  I‚Äôll need to track down a recipe.

The remainder of the day amounted to an ‚ÄúAlmost Knottingham‚Äù with a Genoa chaser.  After setting up in the hotel in Braga and having a quick siesta I decided I was ready to head into the center of town, but try as I might I couldn‚Äôt find anywhere to park the car.  At one point i headed into an underground parking garage and couldn‚Äôt find a space I felt confident getting into.  When I attempted to leave I couldn‚Äôt get out and was forced to pay the minimum fee.  Ugh.  After a few more laps around town I was almost ready to throw in the towel when I spotted another under ground parking complex, this time with a clear indication of open spaces.  

(Ray and I tried visiting Knottinham, but after driving around for an hour not being able to find one single hotel we got fed up and decided to head elsewhere)

Once back above ground on foot I headed into the touristy areas of town and couldn‚Äôt believe how many people there were.  Everyone is visiting Braga right now it seems.  It‚Äôs a very church-y city and something is happening this weekend, I‚Äôm not quite sure what it‚Äôs all about‚Ä¶

I didn‚Äôt go inside one single cathedral or church - I‚Äôm just about churched out at this point.  There is a small English style garden in town, again crawling with tourists but very lovely nonetheless.  

When it game time for grub, All the highest rated restaurants were full.  One of the perks about travelling alone is that you can usually slide into most busy places if you show up early in the service. There‚Äôs always a table no one wants or in a dark corner.  No luck for me tonight.  I looked down a small alley and saw that there was a Thai restaurant, and the ratings on Trip Advisor were pretty good!  I decided to check it out.  It was a very skinny restaurant an once they decided where they could put me I was escorted up to the third floor.  It was a super charming, well decorated place.  With cushions on the floor and a pit to put you legs in, with tables with very short legs. I wondered how old people would get seated but they did have at least one standard height table with chairs.

My server did not speak any English but she did speak very good French so that was perfect!  Dinner was excellent, and anything served in a half-pineapple gets bonus points from me!  I had my first Thai beer and it had a bit of a rice flavour, but couldn‚Äôt read the ingredients list so I might never know!

(I often joke about how I found the food en Italy terrible, that‚Äôs not the joke though.  The joke is that the best meal I had in Italy was a from a Chinese restaurant in Genoa.)

Tomorrow it‚Äôs only a short drive back down the Porto where I‚Äôll spend two days.
