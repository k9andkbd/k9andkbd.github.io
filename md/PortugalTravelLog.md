In just under a week I'll be hopping on a plane headed for Portugal.  This trip was originally planned for April 2020 but the COVID pandamic began and all plans were canceled.  It's hard to believe that two years later and we aren't clear of this thing yet.  I have thought a lot about moving ahead with the trip.  I am fully vacinated and boosted and aside from from the flights, I feel that I wouldn't be any safer staying home.  T-6 days to departure.  Vamos lรก!
