I'll be updating this post as the adventure continues. [Click here](#update) to jump to the latest update.

In just under a week I'll be hopping on a plane headed for Portugal.  This trip was originally planned for April 2020 but then the COVID pandamic began and all plans were canceled.  I find it difficult to believe that it is now two years later and we aren't clear of this thing yet.  I thought a lot about moving ahead with the trip.  I am fully vacinated and boosted. Aside from from the flights, I feel that I wouldn't be any safer staying home.  T-6 days to departure.

Today‚Äôs the day!  I‚Äôve passed my Rapid Antigen test which was very well organized and executed. Then came traveler registration with Portugal, which was an absolutely infuriating and stressful experience due to a poorly designed mobile web form.  I should have completed the form before coming to the Airport.  Live and learn.   Check-in and security were uneventful.  Now I‚Äôve got a few hours to wait before take-off.

Well our flight was delayed leaving Montreal because Toronto temporarily shutdown due to excess air traffic. We left over and hour and a half late but just made our connecting flight.

We are in the air and now I‚Äôm really thinking about Ray, our trips. The fact that I am going to need to be the one in control to make anything happen. 

I am missing him quite a bit right now.   I am experiencing this strange feeling, like I had on our first trip to Europe almost 21 years ago. I hope I‚Äôm smarter now. That I learned something from all of our trips. It‚Äôs the test. I‚Äôm so grateful for everything we were able to do together. 

Looking at the flight map, seeing the dots for Buffalo and Montreal is giving me all kinds of feelings. Thinking about all those times I made that drive in one direction or the other. 

These inflight announcements in Portuguese just sound like some weird mashup of Spanish and Russian to me. 

Landing in Lisbon took a while. Ground fog has put all the planes in a holding pattern but we have to land eventually right?  From above the coastline is so pretty. Crashing waves, green fields, tiny wind turbines dot the landscape. 

I didn‚Äôt realize that there was a shuttle bus to my rental car pickup. Took a taxi. The driver seemed a bit miffed that we weren‚Äôt going farther. When I asked for change he elected to give himself a bit of a tip. Ha! 

The rental car is a 4 door silver something or other. My apprehension over driving stick again turned out to be for nothing - they gave me an automatic for the same price. For some reason the in-car system is all in German.  I‚Äôm rolling with it.

The short drive from Lisbon to Evora was a good primer to driving in Portugal. Seems to be very chill. Once again I am reminded how wonderful and efficient trafic circles are.

Hotel is nice and efficient and clean. Pleasant staff. Decided to stay two days so I have some time to plan my next steps. Not sure if I will head back west to the coast or straight south for Albufeira. 

Evora, a classic walled city. Day one was scouting on foot. Day two will be visiting inside if it‚Äôs raining.

As predicted it rained all morning, so it was the perfect day to look inside a bunch o churches!

First up was the Capela dos Ossis - the Chaple of Bones.  Yeah it‚Äôs as creepy as it sounds. All the interior walls and columns are formed out of piled bones and skulls. Ugh. 

Right next door is the Cathedral of Evora, a hike up to the top of the tower and a walk around the roof is a must.  There is also a ‚ÄúSecret museum‚Äù which was interesting if only for the fact that it made me remember how wacky religious museums are.

The Templo de Diana - Roman ruins is worth a quick stop.

After those and some clearing weather I made my way out from the city center to walk along the Aquaduct.  Inside the city walls homes have been built in the arches but outside the walls you can really get a look at the impressive structure.

I tracked down the Termas Romanas - Ancient Roman baths inside the Evora Council building, which is impressive in it‚Äôs own right.

Before dinner I visited the Evora public park an was delighted to discover it has a local population of peacocks, as well as some ruins which seem to be a popular spot for the fancy birds.

I ate dinner at O Templo - A literal hole in the wall in location only.  The food was excellent and well priced.  The owner Vasco had a story for every dish, many of which were apparently based on his grandmothers recipes.  I‚Äôm still picking up Portuguese but his stories seemed to be mostly the same in English and Portuguese.  I enjoyed the rabbit salad and the black pork cheeks with orange and watercress salad.
