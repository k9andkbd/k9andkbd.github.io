In just under a week I'll be hopping on a plane headed for Portugal.  This trip was originally planned for April 2020 but then the COVID pandamic began and all plans were canceled.  I find it difficult to believe that it is now two years later and we aren't clear of this thing yet.  I thought a lot about moving ahead with the trip.  I am fully vacinated and boosted. Aside from from the flights, I feel that I wouldn't be any safer staying home.  T-6 days to departure.

Today’s the day!  I’ve passed my Rapid Antigen test which was very well organized and executed. Then came traveler registration with Portugal, which was an absolutely infuriating and stressful experience due to a poorly designed mobile web form.  I should have completed the form before coming to the Airport.  Live and learn.   Check-in and security were uneventful.  Now I’ve got a few hours to wait before take-off.
