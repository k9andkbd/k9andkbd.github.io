# AirPods

Sound quality is great, maybe better than the regular EarPods since they stay tightly sealed in my ears.

Paring was super easy.  Open the case near your iPhone, boom.  Switching from iPhone to mac and back again just works.

First test of staying in was to mop the kitchen floor.  Twenty minutes of vigorous mopping and they didn't budge at all.  Also survived a mobbing by the dogs when I went out to the kennel with them in my ears.  Recently I was wearing the regular EarPods and even though I had the cord tucked away someone managed to jump up and snag the cord with a paw.  The EarPods ripped out of my ears and smashed onto the concrete floor.  The right EarPod was completely smashed. Amazingly it still worked but wasn't very comfortable to use.  I'm hoping now that the cord has been eliminated this won't be a problem.  I'm still having visions of one AirPod popping out and one of the dogs grabbing it quick.  I hope I can avoid that.

The first time I forgot to grab my Airpods in the morning and had to make it through a day with out them it was infuriating.  Having to deal with a cord seems like such a barbaric thing now.  It gets caught on everthing - jacket zippers, my toque, backpack straps.  The Airpods have really improved my day in a big way.

Latency seems incredible compared to the Mpow Bluetooth earbuds I used before.
