#[The Boulder Problem](?p=TheBoulderProblem)

I had my first go at some auto belay rope climbing with in 2018 while visting some family a  [Junction in London, Ontario](https://www.junctionclimbing.com).  Not only was the harness very flattering, I had a lot of fun even if I never actually made it to the top of a route.  That was some tough stuff!  I wasn't particulary interested in climbing but it was a fun family outting.


I was able to watch [Free Solo](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=urRVZ4SW7WU) when the documentary came to Disney+ in 2019.  I find the film to be absolutely inspiring and still watch it several times a year.  While I think that Alex Honnold is completely unhinged, his complete mastery of something so difficult and precise makes anything that I need to deal with in my daily life seem absolutely trivial. I like that reminder.  It's all small stuff because I'm not hanging off the side of a cliff with no ropes.

While I have no intention of free soloing anything, the film definately sparked an interest in climbing.  Slowly my Youtube recommendations began to be invaded by climbing and boulding videos.  I had to do something.  

I lost a lot of weight in 2018 and 2019 with swimming and running and eating better but over the last two years I've been at a plateau.  I decided that perhaps boulding would help get me back on track with some goals that were driven by the desire to achieve more rather than just to be able to skip a few more belt holes.

I sent out a call on my work slack to see if any of my collegues were bouldering so I could tag along.  Sure enough I found someone and my first session happened a week or two later.

I began climing outdoors at Nomad Bloc next to Montreal's Olympic Stadium.
