If you are going to listen to rap you should at least listen to something good, so I thought I‚Äôd invest in your musical education a tiny bit!

Here's a link to Apple Music because I'm not even sure if you know how audio CDs work. üòâ

### Beastie Boys Albums ###

* [Licensed to Ill](https://music.apple.com/ca/album/licensed-to-ill/1440912031)
* [Paul‚Äôs Boutique](https://music.apple.com/ca/album/pauls-boutique-20th-anniversary-remastered-edition/721276795) - [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paul%27s_Boutique) - The album did not sell as well as a follow-up to ‚ÄúLicensed to Ill‚Äù but it showed what they were capable of.  Paul's Botique changed Hip-Hop music forever after.
* [Check Your Head](https://music.apple.com/ca/album/check-your-head-deluxe-version-remastered/724303425) - This is where my best friend James really got into the Beastie Boys and I didn't like them at all... too weird!
* [Ill Communication](https://music.apple.com/ca/album/ill-communication-deluxe-version-remastered/72489984) - By 1994 I was fan and I bought this album for James' birthday that year.
* [Hello Nasty](https://music.apple.com/ca/album/hello-nasty-deluxe/721224205) - I bought this album when it came out in 1998 - and it remains one of my favorite albums of all time.  Happy Birthday!	
* [To the 5 Boroughs](https://music.apple.com/ca/album/to-the-5-boroughs-deluxe-version/1467021108) - An excellent follow-up to Hello Nasty and an absolute love letter to New York City in the wake of 9/11.
* [The Mixup](https://music.apple.com/ca/album/the-mix-up/716435010) - The Boys play some funky stuff on this all instrumental album.
* [The Hot Sauce Committee, Pt. Two](https://music.apple.com/ca/album/hot-sauce-committee-pt-two/715797667) - There is no part one. After jaming on The Mixup Up the Boys got back to Rhymin' and Stealin'.

[Here's a playlist of some of my favorite tracks](https://music.apple.com/ca/playlist/erics-favorite-beastie-boys-tracks/pl.u-pp6mTom62L) in no particular order.

### Cool Beastie Boys Music Videos ###

* [Fight for your Right to Party](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eBShN8qT4lk) - It is supopsed to be satire - the very "party bros" they were trying make fun of didn't realize it was a joke - the success of this song, video and tour made them super famous but maybe not for the reasons they wanted.  Watch the documentary below for more.
* [Three MCs and One DJ](https://youtu.be/XflfiylNNXY) - is an epic video, not quite shot in a single take but still well done.
* [Body Movin‚Äô](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uvRBUw_Ls2o)
* [Sabotage](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z5rRZdiu1UE) - Sure this makes sense as a 70's cop show...
* [Intergalactic](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qORYO0atB6g) - Iconic! ü§ñ See also [Celestial Greetings 2019](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xw4pcGyi8Jk).
* [Hey Ladies](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Naf5uJYGoiU)
* [Rhymin' and Stealin'](https://youtu.be/U7M7d8u40I4) - A great live performance from the early days.
* [Don't Play no Game That I Can't Win](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w-QIiVS_7Hs) - I can't explain this one, just watch it.
* [Make Some Noise](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WdgLMslbDuY) - So many [cameos](https://www.billboard.com/music/music-news/beastie-boys-star-studded-make-some-noise-video-premieres-471938/)!

### Beastie Boys Story ###

[Beastie Boys Story](https://tv.apple.com/ca/movie/beastie-boys-story/umc.cmc.6d0mrskjsusw2jd2d228p88c2) - A great Documentary, Mike D and MCA tell the story of Beastie Boys and the early days of rap and hip hop.

I guess if I say so, it is!)
