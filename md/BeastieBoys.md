If you are going to listen to rap you should at least listen to something good, so I thought I‚Äôd invest in your musical education a tiny bit!

When I was your age we would go to the local music store every weekend and I would buy one or two new discs each week, between 15$ and 20$ each. Sometimes all you would have heard was the single that was playing on the radio, and then you would find out the rest of the band's songs were completely different or something you didn't like at all.  Oh well, it's your new favorite album now!  You would also come home with a physical object. The disc itself, sometimes with awesome artwork printed on it. There was also the Jewel box and most of the time there was a fold out pamphelet or book full of more cool art and the lyrics from all the songs.  Now music is essentially free and limitless.  I think it's better like that but something is missing in the experience.  Here's one of my favorite albums that I thought you might enjoy, along with a whole bunch of other stuff to listen to.

Tap the album for a link to Apple Music because I'm not even sure if you can even play an audio CD. üòâ

### Cool Beastie Boys Music Videos ###

* [Fight for your Right to Party](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eBShN8qT4lk) - It is supopsed to be satire - the very "party bros" they were trying make fun of didn't realize it was a joke - the success of this song, video and tour made them super famous but maybe not for the reasons they wanted.  Watch the documentary below for more.
* [Three MCs and One DJ](https://youtu.be/XflfiylNNXY) - is an epic video, not quite shot in a single take but still well done.
* [Body Movin‚Äô](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uvRBUw_Ls2o)
* [Sabotage](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z5rRZdiu1UE) - Sure this makes sense as a 70's cop show...
* [Intergalactic](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qORYO0atB6g) - Iconic! ü§ñ See also [Celestial Greetings 2019](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xw4pcGyi8Jk).
* [Hey Ladies](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Naf5uJYGoiU)
* [Rhymin' and Stealin'](https://youtu.be/U7M7d8u40I4) - A great live performance from the early days.
* [Don't Play no Game That I Can't Win](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w-QIiVS_7Hs) - I can't explain this one, just watch it.
* [Make Some Noise](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WdgLMslbDuY) - So many [cameos](https://www.billboard.com/music/music-news/beastie-boys-star-studded-make-some-noise-video-premieres-471938/)!

[Home](https://music.apple.com/ca/album/home-deluxe-edition/666989860) is a absolute classic album that I listen to all the time. (Can something from 2013 already be a classic?  I guess if I say so, it is!)

[Public Enemy - Fear of a Black Planet](https://music.apple.com/ca/album/fear-of-a-black-planet/1440837282) - James would bring his [5-disc CD player](https://www.ebay.com/p/18030116031) over to my house and we would listen to music for hours.  This album was one of the first and I still listen to it regularly. 

[Rage Against The Machine](https://music.apple.com/ca/album/rage-against-the-machine/191450810) - One of the many bands inspired by the Beastie Boys, and you can hear the references in a lot of their lyrics. James would play "Killing in the Name" in his car really loud and I hated it because they said bad words! Haha!
