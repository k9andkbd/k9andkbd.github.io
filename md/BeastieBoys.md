If you are going to listen to rap you should at least listen to something good. Ahaha!

I thought I’d invest in your musical education a tiny bit!

Here's a link to Apple Music because I'm not even sure if you know how audio CDs work.

### Beastie Boys Albums ###

* [Paul’s Boutique](https://music.apple.com/ca/album/pauls-boutique-20th-anniversary-remastered-edition/721276795) - [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paul%27s_Boutique) - This is the Beastie Boys real breakout moment.  The album did not sell as well as “Licensed to ill” but it shows what they were capable of, and the following albums are all similarly amazing.

* [Ill Communication](https://music.apple.com/ca/album/ill-communication-deluxe-version-remastered/72489984)
* [Hello Nasty](https://music.apple.com/ca/album/hello-nasty-deluxe/721224205) - I bought this album when it came out in 1998 - and it remains one of my favorite albums of all time.  Happy Birthday!	
* [To the 5 Boroughs](https://music.apple.com/ca/album/to-the-5-boroughs-deluxe-version/1467021108) - An excellent follow-up to Hello Nasty and an absolute love letter to New York City in the wake of 9/11.

[Here's a playlist of some of my favorite tracks](https://music.apple.com/ca/playlist/erics-favorite-beastie-boys-tracks/pl.u-pp6mTom62L) in no particular order.

### Cool Beastie Boys Music Videos ###

* [Fight for your Right to Party](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eBShN8qT4lk) - It is supopsed to be satire - the very "party bros" they were trying make fun of didn't realize it was a joke - the success of this song, video and tour made them super famous but maybe not for the reasons they wanted.  Watch the documentary below for more.
* [Three MCs and One DJ](https://youtu.be/XflfiylNNXY)- is an epic video.
* [Alive](https://youtu.be/JkeE2O15RFs)
* [Body Movin’](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uvRBUw_Ls2o)
* [Sabotage](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z5rRZdiu1UE)
* [Intergalactic](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qORYO0atB6g)

[Beastie Boys Story](https://tv.apple.com/ca/movie/beastie-boys-story/umc.cmc.6d0mrskjsusw2jd2d228p88c2) - A great Documentary, Mike D and MCA tell the story of Beastie Boys. It’s really great, I’ve watched it several times.  Just three best friends on an awesome adventure making music together.   RIP MCA.

[Watsky](https://music.apple.com/ca/artist/watsky/340587935) - A genious on the mic blending poetry and rap. Smart lyrics and impecable delivery. Hillarious too!


[Rudimental](https://music.apple.com/ca/playlist/rudimental-essentials/pl.30cee658a239437c87ae495c48871612) - More DnB, R&B and EDM but you might like them. Great lyrics and beats. [Home](https://music.apple.com/ca/album/home-deluxe-edition/666989860) is a absolute classic album that I listen to all the time. (Can something from 2013 already be a classic?  I guess if I say so, it is!)
