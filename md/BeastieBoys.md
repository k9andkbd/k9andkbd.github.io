Merlin’s list


Paul’s Boutique: 

Albums of Note according to me:
* Licensed to Ill
* Paul’s Boutique
    * https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paul%27s_Boutique
    * This is the Beastie Boys real breakout moment.  The album did not sell as well as “Licensed to ill” but it really shows what they were capable of, and the following albums are all similarly amazing.
* Check Your Head
* Ill Communication
* Hello Nasty - I bought this album when it came out in 1998 - and it remains one of my favorite albums of all time.  Happy Birthday!	
* To the 5 Boroughs - An excellent follow-up to Hello Nasty and an absolute love letter to New York City in the wake of 9/11.

Beastie Boys Story:
There’s a wonderful documentary on Apple TV: https://tv.apple.com/ca/movie/beastie-boys-story/umc.cmc.6d0mrskjsusw2jd2d228p88c2 

Mike D and MCA tell the story of Beastie Boys. It’s really great, I’ve watched it several times.
