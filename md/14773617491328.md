# My Heroes All Have Four Feet

Our trip last week to England for [Crufts](http://www.crufts.org.uk) has left me with a whole list of things I want to write about.  Until I have time to sit down and organize my thoughts, here are a few links inspired by the end of Mushing season.  I'm already counting the days until we hit the trails again!

##[The Siberian Husky: Fit for Function or Not?](http://www.dogworld.co.uk/product.php/120827/1/the_siberian_husky_fit_for_function_or_not?_by_sally_leich)##
I missed this last year when it was originally published.  It’s a difficult to walk the line between the show dog and working dog.  Unsound movement, cow-hocked rears, short legs, overly course dogs and a whole host of other problems are all inexcusable in the ring and on the trails.

##[What Makes a Great Sled Dog?](http://news.nationalgeographic.com/news/2015/01/150131-sled-dog-alaskan-husky-racing-iditarod-winter-video-culture/)##
This is a post from last year but it is a good read about what makes a great sled dog.  Most of the dogs running in the Quest and Iditarod today are not Siberians.  Interestingly it would seem that Alaskan Huskies are not only a hodgepodge of other breeds, but also [genetically distinct (pdf)](http://download.springer.com/static/pdf/395/art%253A10.1186%252F1471-2156-11-71.pdf?originUrl=http%3A%2F%2Fbmcgenet.biomedcentral.com%2Farticle%2F10.1186%2F1471-2156-11-71&token2=exp=1458418424~acl=%2Fstatic%2Fpdf%2F395%2Fart%25253A10.1186%25252F1471-2156-11-71.pdf*~hmac=ee3f83ac838ad6c01a7e7e85101dc1e4b21e859c6be5bddc1f3183e7c7fd3cd9)

##[Stumbling Bumbling Sled Dog -  The Onion](http://www.theonion.com/article/stumbling-bumbling-sled-dog-sorry-this-is-my-first-2681)## 
This one is a golden oldie from the ONION.  Curiously the photo of the dog in the article is an Alaskan Malamute, not a Siberian Husky.  I’m willing to chalk this one up as another sly move by he Onion staff.  Most people probably would’t even notice.  No they don’t look anything alike!

##[The White Wall](http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2013/04/22/the-white-wall)##
A bit of history about The Last Great Race on Earth and the 2016 Iditarod champion Dallas Seavey.  After more than 10 years of working with sled dogs, I now understand why someone would be motivated to race over 1,000 miles, alone, in the alaskan wilderness.  That doesn’t mean I don’t think that these people are absolutely insane!  Great dogs are required to compete but the race is more about sleep deprivation and time management.  These are not things I find enjoyable. 

##[How to Train a Sled Dog Team](http://www.outsideonline.com/2061766/how-train-sled-dog-team)##
“Out on the trail, mushers are unquestionably the alpha of the pack, and that means more than just telling the dogs what to do and when to turn. If a musher turns frustrated or disheartened, which is easy to do in a frigid 10-day race, it can affect the dynamic of the whole team.”

##[Our Faces in the Dog's Brain: Functional Imaging Reveals Temporal Cortex Activation during Perception of Human Faces](http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371%2Fjournal.pone.0149431)##
It is pretty interesting but not all that surprising that dogs can recognize faces.  After all, they’ve been learning how to live with humans for more than 20,000 years.
