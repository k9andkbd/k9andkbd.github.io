# The Wolf is Dead, Long Live the Wolf

If you've arrived here via [http://www.darkewolf.com](http://www.darkewolf.com), you should update your links.  The blog that was hosted there has been offline for four years now.  I think after 18 years that it's finally time to retire my online moniker of "DARKeWOLF" from official use.  

The nickname dates back to my days of playing [Quake II](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quake_II) online and hanging out on IRC.  At first I used the nick "darkwolf" on [efnet](http://www.efnet.org) but after frequent nick collisions with another imposter darkwolf I decided to make a name change.  We came up with a long list of options but adding the "e" did the trick.  "<abbr title='I suffered "Do the DEW!" for a while.  Har Har.'>DEW</abbr>" makes a great set of initials for bowling and DARKeWOLF looks pretty bad-ass on a [LaserTron](http://www.lasertron.us) ID card.  There are still lots of other folks using the nickname online, but they aren't me.

I bet you're interested to know what the "e" stands for; *excellent, extraordinary, exemplary, enlightened, earnest, educated, enthusiastic*, Eric!

If you were following [@darkewolf](https://twitter.com/darkewolf) before you should follow [@k9andkbd](https://twitter.com/k9andkbd) now.  There are separate accounts for [@mushometer](https://twitter.com/mushometer) and [@trailroc](https://twitter.com/trailroc).  

I'll keep registering the domain and pointing it here.  It's already been mine for 11 years, might as well keep it.  Of course I still reserve the right to use it when naming characters in video games.
